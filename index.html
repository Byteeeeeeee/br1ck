            <h2>how it works</h2>
            <p>The exploit works because of an issue CR50 chromebooks have when enrolling. If you reset it at just the right time, it will corrupt some data in the FWMP TPM space, resulting in an unreadable FWMP, meaning there are no more protections (besides WP). This allows us to boot into shimmer, unenroll, and fix the brick with <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span></p>

            <h2>how i found the exploit.</h2>
            <p>While trying to do CRSH2TTY, I ended up bricking my device multiple times (a total of four). One time, I randomly tried to disable write protection while unbricking with a SuzyQ, and surprisingly, it worked! This led to the discovery that FWMP doesn't apply while FWMP is corrupted.<br>
            <small>All of my exploits have been made due to CRSH2TTY in some way.</small></p>
        </section>

            <h2>requirements for this exploit</h2>
            <p>1. Luck (or consistency, I am  able to get it very consistently)<br>
            2. A board that was released pre-2021<br>
            As of 29/10/2024 (10/29/2024 for us Americans 🤠), if you have one of the boards listed below, you cannot do the exploit:<br>
            brya, brask, cherry, guybrush, skyrim, rex, nissa, corsola, staryu, geralt<br>
            <small>if your board is older than those, or you know it's a cr50 (NOT TI-50) it will work</small><br>
            3. (PREFERABLY) access to <a href="chrome://network#logs">chrome://network#logs</a>
            </p>

            <h2>steps on how to perform this</h2>
            <p><details>
                <summary><b>[RECOMMENDED] For users with chrome://network#logs (can't be policy blocked, can't use oobescape)</b></summary>
                1. Go to the section below this one (finding the reset times), go through the process, and memorize the time it gives you, then continue <br>
                2. Powerwash and go through the regular setup until the "Getting device ready" screen.<br>
                3. Get a stopwatch ready and wait for the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen. <br>
                4. Wait until you're in the ranges of time (I would go for the higher end) the file uploader gave you, perform an EC-Reset by holding <span class="highlight">Refresh</span> and then clicking <span class="highlight">Power</span>.<br>
                5. If chrome turns back on and its in recovery mode, proceed, otherwise, keep trying (this may take ages but I did it 5 times before the better method was discovered)
                6. Once bricked, get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Legacy">shim</a> (this guide will be using legacy)<br>
                7. Click <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, once it reboots go into recovery mode <span class="highlight">ESC + Refresh + Power</span><br>
                8. Plug in your shim<br>
                9. When the shim boots, run the task corresponding with "Deprovision" <span class="highlight">(D)</span><br>
                10. Next, type <span class="highlight">B</span> to open a bash shell, this is where we'll unbrick<br>
                11. Type the following command <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span><br>
                12. When it says to click <span class="highlight">PP</span> click the power button<br>
                13. Once you're at the end of that process you should reboot and you'll be unenrolled! if you're not, proceed to the bottom section, "errors while unbricking"<br>
                14. THAT ISNT THE END! When you boot into secure mode go in recovery mode, click ctrl + d, enter dev mode, and reboot the shim<br>
                15. Now that you're in the shim (legacy hopefully) run "Enable USB Boot" (or whatever, its the letter U)<br>
                16. click e to reboot and get onto the screen where you would boot from devmode (the os verification is off/boot from internal disk screen)<br>
                17. plug in your shim then click <span class="highlight">ctrl + u</span><br>
                18. deprovise again then click b for the bash shell<br>
                19. run the following command: <span class="highligh">tpm_manager_client destroy_space --index=0x100a</span><br>
                20. reboot and enter vt2<br>
                21. run the following command: <span class="highlight">vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0</span><br>
                22. leave vt2 and you should be good<br>

                1. Powerwash and go through the regular setup until the "Getting device ready" screen.<br>
                2. Get a stopwatch ready and wait for the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen. <br>
                3. Record how long it took for enrollment to finish <br>
                4. Take the time it took, take around 200-500 milliseconds off, proceed <br>
                5. Go back to the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen, wait for the time from step 4, perform an EC-Reset by holding <span class="highlight">Refresh</span> and then clicking <span class="highlight">Power</span>.<br>

            <h3>how to use this?</h3>
            <p>
                1. Powerwash (this seems unnecessary but it'll remove potential errors and make it more accurate)
                1. Go to <a href="chrome://network#logs">chrome://network#logs</a><br>
                2. Under the options section check all of the boxes. <br> <small>You can just select the bottom 2 options if you care.</small><br>
                3. Place the <span class="highlight">combined-logs.tar.gz</span> file into the dropzone below. <br>
                <small>IF YOU SEE "Could not parse for 'Show enrollment screen" PLEASE CHECK THE ERRORS SECTION. IF ISSUES PERSIST, PLEASE DM <a href="https://discord.com/users/1209096766075703368">@appleflyer</a> FOR THIS (other issues go to byte.)</small>
                <br>
                4. The reset timing will appear below the dropzone <br>
