            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The exploit works because of an issue CR50 chromebooks have when enrolling. If you reset it at just the right time, it will (some) corrupt data in the FWMP TPM space, resulting in a bricked FWMP. This allows us to boot into shimmer with <span class="highlight">CTRL + U</span> and clear FWMP for when we fix the brick.</p>

            <h2>How I Found It</h2>
            <p>While trying to do CRSH2TTY, I ended up bricking my device multiple times (a total of four). One time, I randomly tried to disable write protection while unbricking with a SuzyQ, and surprisingly, it worked!<br>
            <small>All of my exploits have been made due to CRSH2TTY in some way.</small></p>

            <h2>How to Do It</h2>
            <p>
                1. Go to the section below this one ("Find Reset Time"), memorize the time it gives you, then continue <br>
                2. Powerwash and go through the regular setup until the "Getting device ready" screen.<br>
                3. Get a stopwatch ready and wait for the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen. 
                4. Wait until you're at the time the file uploader gave you, perform an EC-Reset by holding <span class="highlight">Refresh</span> and then clicking <span class="highlight">Power</span>.<br>
                5. Reboot (<span class="highlight">Refresh + Power</span>). If you're still in recovery mode, click TAB. If the recovery reason is not <span class="highlight">"Recovery Button Pressed"</span>, continue! Otherwise, retry until you get it.<br>
